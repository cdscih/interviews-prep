## Tips for the interview

### General
1. Be SURE to understand the issue well
2. Break everything down into smaller steps and solve them 1 by 1
3. Try brute force giving examples or drawing
4. Give examples of the space and time complexity to see what the interviewer thinks about it

### Optimisations
1. Sorting (merge is good for big datasets, quick for small ones)
2. Binary search
3. Hash maps
4. Two pointers
5. Sliding window
6. Heaps
7. Iterative (to save on space complexity)

### Quick vs Merge

Merge is only good for large datasets (worst case is stil n*logn), but it uses extra space.
Quick is worse in general (worst case is n^2) but better in most cases, it uses no extra space.
