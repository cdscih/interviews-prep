## Tips for the interview

### General
1. Be SURE to understand the issue well
2. Break everything down into smaller steps and solve them 1 by 1
3. Try brute force giving examples or drawing
4. Give examples of the space and time complexity to see what the interviewer thinks about it

### Optimisations
1. Sorting
2. Binary search
3. Hash maps
4. Two pointers
5. Sliding window
6. Heaps
7. Iterative (to save on space complexity)

### Quick vs Merge Sorting

Merge is good for large datasets, it has the worst case being n*logn, but it uses extra space.  
Quick is good for small datasets but it has a terrible worst case of n^2, it uses no extra space.
